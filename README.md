## Project Description/Outline

COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a contagious disease that affected over 72 Million people over the world. In the United States, 16.4 Million have contracted COVID-19 disease and caused the death of 300 thousand people. Several Pharmaceutical companies are working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19 and once available, it will be limited to a target population. The big question is who should get the vaccine first?

The objective of our group project was to determine who the initial recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine should be.


## Research Question to Answer

The aim of the study was to analyze different combinations of available data to determine a correlation between factors such as:

* Date of First Positive Specimen Collection
* Symptom Onset Date
* Current Status
* Sex
* Age Group
* Race and Ethnicity
* Hospitalization Status
* ICU Admission Status
* Presence of Underlying Comorbidity or Disease

The purpose was to create a decision tool to help health care providers distribute vaccines.
